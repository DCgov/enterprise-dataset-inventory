## Enterprise Dataset Inventory

This repository contains the the Jupyter Notebook and datasets that were used to generate the results of the Enterprise Dataset Inventory (EDI) in the [Chief Data Officer's Annual Report](http://opendata.dc.gov/pages/cdo-annual-report) published March 11, 2018. The EDI and Annual Report fulfill the requirements of the [District of Columbia Data Policy](https://octo.dc.gov/page/district-columbia-data-policy) enacted by Mayor Muriel Bowser on April 27, 2017. 

The repository includes Jupyter Notebooks to replicate the 2018 and 2019 reports on the Enterprise Dataset Inventory from the Chief Data Officer's Annual Report. It also includes a notebook that allows users to pull data from the [continually-updated EDI data](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/enterprise-dataset-inventory) on DC's [Open Data Portal](http://opendata.dc.gov) to monitor changes to the EDI over time.

This repository is also available on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) which will allow you to run the Jupyter Notebooks online without installing anything on your local system. Just [click here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DCgov/enterprise-dataset-inventory/master) to access the Binder.
